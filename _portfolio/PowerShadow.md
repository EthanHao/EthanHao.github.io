short-description: "This program takes an interesting approach to protecting your privacy and keeping your computer safe from offenders. 
In short, PowerShadow creates a virtual drive on your computer.
 When you enter shadow mode, the application saves all system changes and user activities on the virtual drive
 instead of on your actual PC. Every time you restart, your machine will revert to its original state, wiping
 away nasties such as spyware and eliminating your surfing and application histories.
 However, since this process also will wipe away useful changes such as edits in a Word document,
 you must remember to save things you want to keep on your actual hard drive. In general, 
 the app's interface is elegant and easy to navigate, and it didn't appear to slow our PC when running in the background. 
 PowerShadow will be especially useful for those who share computers, but other folks may find it another useful weapon in the war against adware.
