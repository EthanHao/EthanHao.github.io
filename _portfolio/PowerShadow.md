short-description: "This program takes an interesting approach to protecting your privacy and keeping your computer safe from offenders. 
In short, PowerShadow creates a virtual drive on your computer.
 When you enter shadow mode, the application saves all system changes and user activities on the virtual drive
 instead of on your actual PC. Every time you restart, your machine will revert to its original state, wiping
 away nasties such as spyware and eliminating your surfing and application histories."
